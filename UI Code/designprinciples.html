    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="box">  
        <h3>What Are Design Priniciples?</h3>
        <p>Web Design is the biggest influence in whether or not a website is successful. Not only do we design visually appealing website,
        we also follow a number of guidelines to make sure our websites are usable by all.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Website accessibility does not mean designing website for people with disabilities, but simply designing for everyone.
            Having a website that is accessible by everyone benefits your business as it not only makes sure are your customers can 
            use you website, but it allow ehances the overall user experience.</p>
            <h4>1.Typeface & Readability</h4>
            <img src="print.jpg" alt="print" class="print">

            <p>We use web standard fonts - clear, not decorated, not adorned fonts, that can easily we read. We also use standard
                font size - 12-22pt for body text and 18-22+pt for headings. </p>

                <h4>2.Semantic Coding</h4>
    
                <p>Semantic Code is the way is describing what our content is on our website so it can be understood by the 
                    web browser.By using the correct tags, we can tell the browser what is the most important content on the page.
                    Why is this important ? There are two reasons -1)When we Google something the web browser searches for relevant
                    pages. If our website is not tagged with the relevant tags, then our website will not appear in peoples searches.
                    2) Where accessibility comes into play - semantic coding is a hugely important accessibility principle. People
                    with vision impairments use screen readers to navigate the web.Unless the page is coded semantically, the screen
                    reader will struggle to understand. An example of this is Alt Tags.Alt Tags or Alternative Tags are are writtin 
                    into the code with images. They are a short description of what the images are. This way, if someone cannot see 
                    the image, a screen reader can still describe the image to them.
                 </p>

                 <h4>3.Navigation</h4>
            <img src="navigation.jpg" alt="websitenavigation" class="nav">

            <p>When designing a website, we have to keep in mind not everyone will use our website the same. Some people
                will be on laptops, someone people will use a desktop, some people will us the keypad, others will have a 
            mouse. In the same way, users will navigate through the page differently. By organizing our content, we can ensure
            everyone can navigate effortlessy through the pages.We do this by giving each page a head and a title, allowing
            more than one route to a web page and with content and heading, making sure the user knows what page they are
            on</p>

    
        <div class="responsivebox">
                <h5>Responsive Web Design</h5>
                <img src="responsive.jpg" alt="responsivewebdesignimagery" class="responsive">
                <p>The use of smartphones and tablet are growing. So it is more important that ever for our Web Designs to
                    be compatible. We want these users to have the same experience those using laptops or desktops are. 
                    By utilizing HTML and CSS we can shrink and resize the page so it is compatible will all devices.
                </p>

        <div class="visualbox">
                <h6>Visual Design</h6>
                <p>First impressions are important. A website might work well but if it doesn't look good then you are definiely losing
                    users. With our background in Graphic Design, visual design is very important to us. We want to create websites
                    that represent you and your business.</p>

                <h4>Colors & Imagery</h4>
                <img src="colors.jpg" alt="emotivecolorchart" class="color">
                <p>Choosing the right color palette and imagery can enhance user experience. B the color palette and the imagery
                    set the mood for the website and can either immediately attract the customer or instantly deter them. </p>

                    
                <h4>The F Pattern</h4>
                <img src="fpattern.jpg" alt="the f pattern example on webpage" class="fpattern">
                <p>When we are scanning through a webpage we follow an F Pattern. We first scan across the top for headings
                and titles, we then scan down through the page in search of any highlighted text or bullet points. Finally
                we scan across the body. By designing our website with this is mind, we can ensure we that the content that is most 
                important is seen first. If we can get the most eyecatching content along the top of the page or down the side we can
                grab our customers attention in the first few seconds of being on the webpage. </p>

                <div class="audiencebox">
                    <h3>The Audience</h3>
                    <p>What is the single most important principle in Web Design? Remembering who the audience is. Your users
                    are at the forefront of all our designs. We consider what the audience want, what they love, what they have,
                    what are their fears, what are their joys. By doing this we are able to design website that speak directly 
                    to your users.
